# Circle of Fifths Practice
A little python script for testing and practicing your circle of fifths knowledge. Right now two tests exist:
- Key Signature Identification
- Interval Identification

![screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/6vapDOD.png)

Key Signature Identification will select a random key from the circle of fifths and ask for all the sharps or flats in that key. You can enter them as a comma separated list.

Interval Identification will select a random root and ask for a random interval (Major and Minor Thirds, Major and Minor Sevenths and Fifths).


## Use

Download the script and execute it with Python:

`wget https://github.com/Skyl3r/CircleOfFifthsPractice/blob/master/CircleOfFifths.py`

`python3 CircleOfFifths.py`


## To Do
- Accept sharp spellings when appropriate for interval identification (IE, Major Seventh of D should be C# not Db)
