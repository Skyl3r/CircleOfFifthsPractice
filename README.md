# CircleOfFifthsPractice
A little python script for testing and practicing your circle of fifths knowledge. Right now two tests exist:
- Key Signature Identification
- Interval Identification

Key Signature Identification will select a random key from the circle of fifths and ask for all the sharps or flats in that key. You can enter them as a comma separated list.
Interval Identification will select a random root and ask for a random interval (Major and Minor Thirds, Major and Minor Sevenths and Fifths).


## To Do
- Accept sharp spellings when appropriate for interval identification (IE, Major Seventh of D should be C# not Db)
